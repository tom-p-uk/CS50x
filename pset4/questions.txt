0.  BMP - 32 bit color (over 4 billion)
	GIF - 8 bits (256)
	JPEG - 24 bit (16 million)
	PNG - 24 bit (16 million)
	
1.  GIF files support animation.
    
2.  Lossy compression loses/discards data during compression.
    Lossless compression can be reversed, and discards no data.
    
3.  JPEG.
    
4.  The address of the file is removed, but the data itself is not deleted.

5.  Secure delete replaces the files information with all zeroes, which is a
	safer option.
	
6.  stdint is a header file that contains a set of defined, fixed width	integers.

7.  It means the program will always be portable. 
	The variable widths will not change depending on the computer being used.

8.  BYTE - 1 byte
	DWORD - 4 bytes
	LONG - 4 bytes
	WORD - 2 bytes

9.  The first two bytes of a bitmap bust contain the ASCII characters 'B' and 'P'.

10. bisize stores the size of the image itself, whereas bfsize stores the size of the image,
	as well as other data, such as headers.

11. If the bitmap height is positive the file will be a bottom up DIB 
	where the bottom row of the image will be the first row of the file.
	The opposite is the case when the bitmap height is positive.
	
12. biBitCount

13. If fopen cannot find the file to open, it will return NULL.

14. Because we want to read one pixel at a time, which in the cae of resize,
	will be a single struct file.
	
15. Each row must be a multiple of 4 bytes. If not, padding is added.
	3 pixels x 3 bytes for each pixel = 9 bytes per row. 3 bytes of padding
	must be added.
	
16. fseek allows you to move to a designated point in a file.

17. The final argument passed to fseek should be the location in the file 
	from which you would like to move. SEEK_CUR is the current position in the file.
